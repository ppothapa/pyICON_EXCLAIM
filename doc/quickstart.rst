Quickstart
----------

The easiest way to start is probably by using some of the example scripts from the directory ``example_scripts``. 
Best is to start with ``examp_pyicon_start.py`` either by typing::

  python example_scripts/examp_pyicon_start.py

or by using ipython::

  cd example_scripts
  ipython --pylab
  %run examp_pyicon_start.py

If you prefer to use notebooks, you can also start a Jupyter Python session and try one of the notebooks in ``notebook``. 
A beginner example is ``examp_pyicon_start.ipynb``.
