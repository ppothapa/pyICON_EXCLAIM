pyicon-view
===========

Pyicon-view aims to re-produce some ncview like plotting options.
It is possible to load an ICON data set and click through the time or depth axes. 
All variables within the file can be depicted, color limits can be set and the plot can be manipulated e.g. by adding Rectangles.

Example notebooks how to use pyicon-view are the following:

  * ``pyicon_view_r2b6.ipynb``
  * ``pyicon_view_r2b8.ipynb``
  * ``pyicon_view_smt.ipynb``
  * ``pyicon_view_dyamond++.ipynb``
  * ``pyicon_view_cdo_remapped.ipynb``

Note that these notebooks cannot be shown by simply opening them via GitLab in the browser but they need to be opened within a Jupyter Notebook session.
